### Bring depth and elegance to your dashboard with blurred glass panels and soft UI touches. ☀️


This theme brings a sophisticated "**Frosted Glass**" aesthetic to your dashboard, combining transparency with elegant blurring effects to create a truly unique and contemporary look. Designed for both visual appeal and comfortable usability, the Frosted Glass Theme transforms your Home Assistant interface into a work of art. 🖼️

## ✨ Features

- **Frosted Glass Aesthetic**: Transparent and blurred card elements create depth and layering. ❄️
- **Light & Dark Modes**: Choose between a bright, clean look or a soft dark interface. ☀️🌑
- **Modern Design**: Rounded corners, minimal shadows, and cohesive color palettes. 🛋️
- **Enhanced UX**: Designed to feel fluid, comfortable, and polished. 🖼️
- **Lite Editions**: Optional no-blur builds for older or low-end devices. They keep the same semi-transparent, glassy look while improving performance. ⚡
- **Home Assistant 2026.8 Ready**: Uses the current form, switch and border-radius theme tokens, with validated single-mode declarations.
- **Two Styling Engines**: Works with UIX and remains compatible with card-mod.
- **Want to Customize? (New!)**: Install Frosted Glass Theme Manager to choose your own color&background! 🎨

## 🚀 Quick Installation Guide

**Step 1: Prerequisites**
- Make sure [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) is installed.
- Install exactly one styling engine through HACS:
  - [`UIX`](https://github.com/Lint-Free-Technology/uix), the actively developed successor to card-mod. UIX understands this theme's existing card-mod keys, so migration does not require dashboard changes.
  - [`card-mod`](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod), for existing installations that prefer to stay on card-mod.

Do not install both engines at the same time. They can both try to patch the same Home Assistant elements.

**Step 2: Install Theme via HACS**

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and install via HACS](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=WessamLauf&repository=homeassistant-frosted-glass-themes&category=theme)

**Step 3: Restart Home Assistant**

**Step 4: Activate Theme**
- Go to your profile (bottom-left corner of Home Assistant UI), and select **Frosted Glass**, **Frosted Glass Light** or **Frosted Glass Dark** from the theme dropdown.

-----

> ⚠️ **Note:** This theme requires either [UIX](https://github.com/Lint-Free-Technology/uix) or [card-mod](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod) to render the glass styling. UIX is a drop-in option for this theme because it includes compatibility aliases for `card-mod-theme`, `card-mod-card` and `card-mod-root`.

> Additionally, **Markdown cards** that are text-only will still receive the theme’s glass/border styling (themes can’t reliably detect “text-only” variants). If you want a truly plain text-only Markdown card, add this to that card (copy&paste ready):

```yaml
card_mod:
  style: |
    ha-card {
      background: none !important;
      backdrop-filter: none !important;
      -webkit-backdrop-filter: none !important;
      box-shadow: none !important;
      border: none !important;
    }
    ha-card::before {
      content: none !important;
      background: none !important;
      backdrop-filter: none !important;
      -webkit-backdrop-filter: none !important;
    }
```


> 💡 **Optional:** To match the navigation bar shown in screenshots, install the [lovelace-navbar-card](https://github.com/joseluis9595/lovelace-navbar-card).

## 🧩 Known Issues & Limitations

> These are known limitations caused by platform constraints, aggressive CSS behavior in certain custom cards, or performance trade-offs. Workarounds may be possible in some cases via `card-mod`.


### 1. **Hue-Like Light Card Text Visibility**
🪔 [#5](https://github.com/wessamlauf/homeassistant-frosted-glass-themes/issues/5)
When the light is **on**, text inside the `custom:hue-like-light-card` may turn black and become unreadable against the card background.
This card aggressively reapplies internal styles that override theme-level colors, even with `!important` declarations.
➡️ *Currently not fixable from the theme side.*


### 2. **stack-in-card Incompatibility**
🧱 [#44](https://github.com/wessamlauf/homeassistant-frosted-glass-themes/issues/44)
Cards rendered inside `custom:stack-in-card` are deeply nested, and the theme’s `::before` blur cannot be excluded reliably for inner elements.
➡️ *Recommended workaround: Use `card-mod` inside each card to manually disable the `::before` layer.*


### 3. **Performance on Low-End Devices**
The heavy use of `backdrop-filter: blur()` may cause noticeable lag on low-end hardware (older tablets, Pi-based dashboards, etc.).
➡️ Tip: **The Lite version** (no blur) for the same glassy look without blur, dramatically better performance, and no dropdown misplacement.
